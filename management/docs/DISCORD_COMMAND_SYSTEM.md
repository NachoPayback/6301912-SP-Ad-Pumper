# Discord Command System

## üéØ Overview

The Discord integration has been **completely redesigned** to eliminate spam and provide **on-demand control**:

**OLD SYSTEM (Spammy):** Every user action automatically sent to Discord
**NEW SYSTEM (Smart):** Discord is your **command & control center**

## üöÄ How It Works

### Architecture
- **Supabase Database:** Stores all user data, analytics, and ad interactions
- **Discord Controller:** Checks for commands and responds with data on-demand
- **No More Spam:** Discord only gets what you request

### Command Flow
1. You update a command file (GitHub Gist, file, or API endpoint)
2. Extension checks for new commands every 30 seconds
3. Commands are executed and results sent to Discord
4. Clean, organized responses instead of constant spam
