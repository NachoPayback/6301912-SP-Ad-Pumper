# Scammer Payback Promoter Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that generates promotional banners to help grow the Scammer Payback community and fight against scammers.

## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Unobtrusive banners** that appear in corners of websites
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable settings** for frequency and display time
- üéØ **Smart positioning** alternating between top-right and bottom-right
- üì± **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- üîí **Privacy-focused** with no data collection
- ‚ú® **Smooth animations** and modern UI design

## Installation

### Method 1: Developer Mode (Recommended)

1. **Download the extension files** to a folder on your computer
2. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Enable Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner
4. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the folder containing the extension files
5. **Pin the extension** by clicking the puzzle piece icon and pinning "Scammer Payback Promoter"

### Method 2: Chrome Web Store (Future)
*This extension could be published to the Chrome Web Store for easier installation.*

## How It Works

The extension uses intelligent site-specific ad placement logic:

- **Site-aware placement** - different logic for Google, YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and generic sites
- **Safe ad locations** - never interferes with navigation, search boxes, or UI elements
- **Random rotation** - every 25 seconds, randomly shows either:
  - **2 banner ads** (70% chance) - placed in proper ad locations only
  - **1 corner toast** (30% chance) - text notification in screen corner
- **6 different banner sizes** - uses standard web advertising formats (160x600, 300x250, 320x50, 336x280, 728x90, 970x250)
- **Google-specific logic** - prioritizes right sidebar, creates dedicated ad areas if needed
- **Proper document flow** - banners are part of page content, not overlays
- **Actual ad sizing** - banners display at their true pixel dimensions
- **Persistent presence** - if closed, new content appears within seconds
- **Click-to-subscribe** functionality that opens Scammer Payback's channel

## Settings

Access settings by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar:

- **Enable/Disable** the extension
- **Banner Frequency** (10% - 80% chance)
- **Display Duration** (3-15 seconds)
- **Cooldown Time** (1-10 minutes)
