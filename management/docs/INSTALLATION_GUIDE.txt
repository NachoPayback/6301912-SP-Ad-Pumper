QUICK INSTALLATION GUIDE - Scammer Payback Promoter

STEP 1: PREPARE THE EXTENSION
1. Make sure all files are in one folder
2. (Optional) Add icon files to the assets/ folder (see assets/ICONS_NEEDED.txt)

STEP 2: INSTALL IN CHROME
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Type "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar and press Enter
3. Turn ON "Developer mode" (toggle switch in top-right corner)
4. Click "Load unpacked" button
5. Select the folder containing these extension files
6. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

STEP 3: PIN THE EXTENSION (RECOMMENDED)
1. Click the puzzle piece icon (üß©) in Chrome's toolbar
2. Find "Scammer Payback Promoter" in the list
3. Click the pin icon (üìå) next to it
4. The extension icon will now appear in your toolbar

STEP 4: TEST THE EXTENSION
1. Visit any website (try Google, YouTube, Reddit for best results)
2. Ads will appear within 2 seconds automatically
3. Every 25 seconds, you'll randomly see either:
   - 2 banner ads placed in proper ad locations (70% chance)
   - 1 corner toast notification (30% chance)
4. Try closing a banner - a new one will appear after a few seconds
5. On Google: banners appear in right sidebar or dedicated ad areas
6. On other sites: banners go to sidebars, between content, never over UI
7. Look for banners integrated as part of page content at actual sizes

STEP 5: CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS
- Click the extension icon in your toolbar
- Adjust banner frequency (how often they appear)
- Change display time (how long they stay visible)
- Set cooldown time (wait time between banners)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- No banners showing? Check if the extension is enabled in chrome://extensions/
- Banners appearing too often? This is normal - they're designed to always be visible
- Extension not loading? Check that all files are in the same folder

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Ads appear on ALL websites including YouTube as real content
- Uses 6 standard advertising banner sizes (160x600, 300x250, 320x50, 336x280, 728x90, 970x250)
- Banners are injected into page HTML like legitimate advertisements at actual pixel sizes
- Extension uses local storage only (no data sent anywhere)
- Every 25 seconds randomly shows either 2 banners OR 1 toast (not both)
- Smart placement avoids navigation, headers, and UI elements
- Banners go to appropriate content areas (sidebars, between paragraphs, etc.)
- Settings are saved automatically and sync across your Chrome devices

UNINSTALLING:
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Scammer Payback Promoter"
3. Click "Remove" and confirm

That's it! The extension will now help promote Scammer Payback while you browse the web. üõ°Ô∏è
